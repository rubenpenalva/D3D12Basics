Next project thoughts
=====================
* Minimize the use of size_t. 
    Is there a good reason for using size_t everywhere?
    what about just using an int?
* Minimize the use of comptrs. Only use them when needed otherwise use naked ptrs.
* Get rid of std::wstringstream to format strings. Use somekind of safe printf?
* Management of the frame and scene stats is terrible. Rework it.
* Rework the game loop to consume way less cpu. Better power efficiency.
